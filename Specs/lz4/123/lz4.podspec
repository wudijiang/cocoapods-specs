                   LZ4 is a very fast lossless compression algorithm, providing compression
                   speed at 400 MB/s per core, scalable with multi-cores CPU. It also features
                   an extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core, typically
                   reaching RAM speed limits on multi-core systems.
